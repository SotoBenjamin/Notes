> > Reading and writing the memory and register file and using the ALU typically constitute the biggest delays in the processor. We choose five pipeline stages so that each stage involves exactly one of these slow steps. Specifically, we call the five stages Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback.

> > In the Fetch stage, the processor reads the instruction from instruction memory. In the Decode stage, the processor reads the source operands from the register file and decodes the instruction to produce the control signals. In the Execute stage, the processor performs a computation with the ALU. In the Memory stage, the processor reads or writes data memory. Finally, in the Writeback stage, the processor writes the result to the register file, when applicable.
